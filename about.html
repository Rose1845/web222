          Hi, my name is Rose Nyaugenya and I'm a web developer based in
          Toronto, Canada. I created this website as a way to showcase my skills
          and passion for game design. The game I chose to feature on this site
          is Chess, which has been a favorite of mine since childhood.
        </p>

        <p>
          In creating this site, I drew inspiration and resources from various
          sources. The rules of the game were adapted from the official Chess
          website (https://www.chess.com/rules). The images used on the site
          were sourced from Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/) and edited using
          Adobe Photoshop.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, I'm proud of how this site turned out and hope that visitors
          will enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed creating it.
